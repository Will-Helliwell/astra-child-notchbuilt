This is a template for new astra child projects.

It contains a page template for the homepage, which is :
- Modular - template parts are reusable and can be reordered
- Styled identically to using the default astra page template (client can use gutenberg block editor, astra toggle title works)
- But allows insertion of custom template parts at any location

It also contains:
- Styles.css - removes astra full width
- Functions.php - loads all shortcodes (none created yet)

To do in Astra customizer:
- Set everything to full width
- Remove headers and footers
